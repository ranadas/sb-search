John McCain (R-AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) called for tougher sanctions against Russia Sunday over hacking allegations. “We will be working for much tougher sanctions against Russia,” McCain said. “They attacked the United States of America.

Graham said he hopes to “make 2017 a year of offense.” He said in front of reporters, “We believe that [Vladimir] Putin has hacked into our elections in America, that he’s trying to undermine democracy all over the world, and it’s time for new sanctions to hit him hard.” (h/t RCP Video) Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T10:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T05:41:10.846+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
