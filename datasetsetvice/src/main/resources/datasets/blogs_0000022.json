Swansea City's Angel Rangel celebrates scoring his side's second goal \nSam Allardyce, meanwhile, is still chasing a first win in charge of the club, having added a second-straight defeat to their draw with Watford in his first game in charge. \nSwansea had the extra day of rest heading into the game, and it showed in the first 45 minutes as they dominated virtually throughout. \nFernando Llorente was the first to go close after six minutes, heading wide from close range after Wayne Routledge had dinked a lovely cross into his path. \nThe Swans then saw great chances go amiss for Ki Sung-yueng, Federico Fernandez and Routledge, and it would have cost them were it not for Palace being controversially denied a penalty after 33 minutes. \nOne long ball from goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey managed to beat the entire Swansea defence, and Christian Benteke raced onto it before appearing to be tripped by Lukasz Fabianski as he attempted to round him. Referee Paul Tierney, however, waved it away, much to the fury of the home fans at Selhurst Park. \nAnd to add to their anger, Swansea finally did take the lead three minutes before half-time, as Mawson did well to flick a header from Gylfi Sigurdsson's inswinging free-kick into the bottom corner. Alfie Mawson (2nd L) celebrates scoring the opening goal for Swansea \nPalace were forced to withdraw Benteke at half-time after the striker got injured during the penalty incident in the first half, with Fraizer Campbell replacing him up top. \nSam Allardyce then threw on Bakary Sako for Andros Townsend shortly afterwards, and the changes helped to vastly improve Palace's attacking play, with Sako wanting a penalty in the 77th minute after going down under a challenge from Rangel, who also appeared to handle it, only for appeals to be denied again. \nZaha switched to the right and immediately provided a real threat to Swansea, but it was a drift into the middle that finally saw Palace grab the equaliser seven minutes from time. \nAnd it was a sensational finish from the newly-converted Ivory Coast winger, playing his final game before heading to the African Cup of Nations. Martin Kelly's cross was just behind Zaha, but he managed to wheel his body around and thrash a volley home from the edge of the area. \nIt was a goal worthy of a Premier League point in any context, but it wasn't to be for Palace as Swansea managed to nick it late on as substitute Rangel was found by Leroy Fer while running in behind, before finishing smartly past Hennessey to send the away fans into jubilation. \nPlayer ratings \nCrystal Palace: Hennessey (6), Kelly (6), Delaney (5), Tomkins (5), Ward (5), Ledley (6), Cabaye (6), Puncheon (5), Townsend (5), Zaha (7), Benteke (4) \nSubs: Campbell (6), Sako (6), Mutch (n/a) \nSwansea: Fabianski (6), Naughton (7), Fernandez (7), Mawson (8), Taylor (7), Ki (7), Fulton (6), Cork (6), Routledge (6), Sigurdsson (7), Llorente (6) \nSubs: Rangel (7), Fer (6), Dyer (n/a) \nMan of the match: Alfie Mawson", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T00:33:39.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
