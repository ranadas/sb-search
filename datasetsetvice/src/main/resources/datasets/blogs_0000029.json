Kangana Ranaut will seen shaking some booty in her gritty drama, Simran By Soumyata Chauhan  57 pm Kangana Ranaut is still not over her ex Hrithik Roshan and these quotes here for proof \nKangana Ranaut will be soon shooting for a special dance number for her upcoming film, Simran. Though Hansal Mehta’s film is a serious close-to-life drama, the makers felt the need of a dance song. The dance is said to give the audience a respite from the gritty story line. We hear that a huge set is being erected for the shoot at a suburban studio. \nFor those who don’t know Kangana’s 2017 release, Simran , is based on a real-life incident that is set in US. And no, the actress is NOT playing Simran in the film. The three-time National Award winner will essay the role of Prafull Patel, a 30-year old divorcee. The film deals with the issues faced by divorcees. Earlier we reported how the actress was attending workshops to prep herself for the challenging role. “Kangana is a known perfectionist and hence she is preparing intensively for her character. This is the first time when she will essay such a role and she wants to take no chances with it,” a source said in a statement. \nThis is the first time that she is working with Hansal Mehta . It was under his direction that Rajkummar Rao won his first National Award as the Best Actor for Shahid. There are also high hopes that Manoj Bajpayee will get the same award for his brilliant performance in Aligarh, again directed by Hansal Mehta. Looking both of their track records,all we can say is that Kangana is in high contention for bagging her fourth National award with Simran. \nScripted by Apurva Asrani, the film and also stars Rajkummar Rao. Producer Shailendra Singh had taken to Twitter to announce the release date of the movie “#Simran is on 17th sept. 2017.. @mehtahansal @Apurvasrani.” Mark your calendars, guys!  57 pm Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T14:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T09:29:16.909+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
