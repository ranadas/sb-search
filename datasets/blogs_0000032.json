Capello, who was Guardiola's manager at Roma during the 2002-03 season, believes the remarks regarding his future were down to a potential return to Camp Nou, where Guardiola spent the vast majority of his playing and coaching days. \n“Guardiola’s football is fundamentally always the same and if the opponents figure out counter-measures, he has to find an alternative,\" Capello told Sky Italy. \n“In any case, I think if he made these statements, it is also because in my view he has the idea of becoming President of Barcelona.” \nGuardiola led Manchester City to a 2-1 win over Burnley in their last Premier League outing, despite Fernandinho's first half red card. \nWin or bust: Spurs must prove title mettle \nHowever, the Catalan's dismissive interviews following the victory led to supporters questioning his attitude, shortly after the comments of his coaching future were aired. \n\"I will not be on the bench until I am 60 or 65 years old. I feel that the process of my goodbye has already started,\" the City boss told NBC Sports.
