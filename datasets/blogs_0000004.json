Now in training he starts to score goals. I am sure he will score as well in the games,\" Wenger stated at a news conference. \n\"I believe he is always available, quick in his movement, wants the ball, can hold people off. On top of that, now he starts to score goals. People forget he is 20 years old. I think he had a very good game. \n\"His quality of pass, of availability, is exceptional for a young boy. He lacked a bit of quality of [receptiveness] in dangerous areas and I hope that these goals he scores now will give him the taste as well to go where he can finish it off.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-02T05:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-02T01:13:22.976+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
