Em. GEE! That is everything we could’ve asked for and more. Mel seems to concur, posting this shot of her and Victoria to her page and writing, “Candle light and soul forever. A wonderful start to 2017. XXX.” \nLook at how cute they are together! \nWe hope our 2017 is filled with more of where this came from, ladies — you just made our year! \nAre you super stoked to see these two on stage together?
