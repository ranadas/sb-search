Akintoye Badare confirmed the incident, which he said occurred at about 10 am at Bakin Dutse, near Gulak town. \nBadare did not say whether the suspected female bombers were children or adults. \n“Things are now okay. Our men are at alert as usual,” Badare said. \nNAN recalls that the Army had on Tuesday repelled attacks from some fleeing insurgents at Dar village in the same local government.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-04T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-01-04T17:12:44.134+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
