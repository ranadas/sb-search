Militants in northeast Syria are now estimated to have abducted at least 220 Assyrian Christians this week, a group monitoring the war reported. of \nThe U.K.-based group's annual Persecution Trends report says that apart from the rise of brutalities against Christians in the Middle East, there's a reason to worry about the safety of Christians also in India and China. \n\"In India, recorded attacks from Hindu militants have increased dramatically, and in China, pressure is building on unregistered churches,\" Release International says. \n\"Around the world Christians face an increasing array of violent persecutors. These include the brutal Islamic State in the Middle East, heavily armed militants in Nigeria and Hindu extremists in India,\" says Release Chief Executive Paul Robinson, adding that the trend should serve as \"a wake-up call to take our prayers and practical support for our persecuted family to a new level.\" \nThe refugee crisis in the regions neighbouring conflict-ridden Syria and Iraq is likely to continue in 2017, the group says, noting that one focus will be Kurdistan in northern Iraq, which is now home to nearly 2 million internally displaced people, including Christians. \nThe Islamic State terror group, also known as IS, ISIS, ISIL or Daesh, has tortured, sexually abused and even crucified those who refuse to renounce their faith in Syria and Iraq. \nPersecution in the Shia Muslim nation of Iran is also on the rise, and the clampdown on underground churches will likely carry on, the group warns. \nIn Nigeria, Christian communities in north and central parts continue to face widespread violence at the hands of heavily armed Fulani militants. The military defeat the Boko Haram group is suffering has not brought down the suffering of Christians there, the group adds. \nIn Pakistan, Christians have been suffering accusations of blasphemy and bombings, the group notes. \nFree sign up cp newsletter!
